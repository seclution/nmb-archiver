# Upgrading Meilisearch

Meilisearch, the search engine used by NMB Archiver, requires a manual data migration process when upgrading to a new version. This is because Meilisearch databases are only compatible with the specific version that created them.

If an NMB Archiver upgrade includes a major Meilisearch version change, you will need to migrate your search index by following the process below.

## Experimental: Dumpless Upgrade

> **Warning:** This feature is currently **experimental**. We do not recommend using it for production environments until it is marked as stable. Please use the [standard migration process](#standard-migration-process-recommended) instead. Proceed with caution.

Meilisearch recently introduced an experimental "dumpless" upgrade method. This allows you to migrate the database to a new Meilisearch version without manually creating and importing a dump. However, please note that **dumpless upgrades are not currently atomic**. If the process fails, your database may become corrupted, resulting in data loss.

**Prerequisite: Create a Snapshot**

Before attempting a dumpless upgrade, you **must** take a snapshot of your instance. This ensures you have a recovery point if the upgrade fails. Learn how to create snapshots in the [official Meilisearch documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/data_backup/snapshots).

### How to Enable

To perform a dumpless upgrade, you need to configure your Meilisearch instance with the experimental flag. You can do this in one of two ways:

**Option 1: Using an Environment Variable**

Add the `MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_DUMPLESS_UPGRADE` environment variable to your `docker-compose.yml` file for the Meilisearch service.

```yaml
services:
  meilisearch:
    image: getmeili/meilisearch:v1.x # The new version you want to upgrade to
    environment:
      - MEILI_MASTER_KEY=${MEILI_MASTER_KEY}
      - MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_DUMPLESS_UPGRADE=true
```

**Option 2: Using a CLI Option**

Alternatively, you can pass the `--experimental-dumpless-upgrade` flag in the command section of your `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
services:
  meilisearch:
    image: getmeili/meilisearch:v1.x # The new version you want to upgrade to
    command: meilisearch --experimental-dumpless-upgrade
```

After updating your configuration, restart your container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Meilisearch will attempt to migrate your database to the new version automatically.

## Standard Migration Process (Recommended)

For self-hosted instances using Docker Compose, the recommended migration process involves creating a data dump from your current Meilisearch instance, upgrading the Docker image, and then importing that dump into the new version.

### Step 1: Create a Dump

Before upgrading, you must create a dump of your existing Meilisearch data. You can do this by sending a POST request to the `/dumps` endpoint of the Meilisearch API.

1.  **Find your Meilisearch container name**:

    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```

    Look for the service name that corresponds to Meilisearch, usually `meilisearch`.

2.  **Execute the dump command**:
    You will need your Meilisearch Admin API key, which can be found in your `.env` file as `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/dumps' \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MEILI_MASTER_KEY"
    ```

    This will start the dump creation process. The dump file will be created inside the `meili_data` volume used by the Meilisearch container.

3.  **Monitor the dump status**:
    The dump creation request returns a `taskUid`. You can use this to check the status of the dump.

    For more details on dump and import, see the [official Meilisearch documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/update_and_migration/updating).

### Step 2: Upgrade Your NMB Archiver Instance

Once the dump is successfully created, you can proceed with the standard NMB Archiver upgrade process.

1.  **Pull the latest changes and Docker images**:

    ```bash
    git pull
    docker compose pull
    ```

2.  **Stop the running services**:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

### Step 3: Import the Dump

Now, you need to restart the services while telling Meilisearch to import from your dump file.

1.  **Modify `docker-compose.yml`**:
    You need to temporarily add the `--import-dump` flag to the Meilisearch service command. Find the `meilisearch` service in your `docker-compose.yml` and modify the `command` section.

    You will need the name of your dump file. It will be a `.dump` file located in the directory mapped to `/meili_data` inside the container.

    ```yaml
    services:
        meilisearch:
            # ... other service config
            command:
                [
                    '--master-key=${MEILI_MASTER_KEY}',
                    '--env=production',
                    '--import-dump=/meili_data/dumps/YOUR_DUMP_FILE.dump',
                ]
    ```

2.  **Restart the services**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    Meilisearch will now start and import the data from the dump file. This may take some time depending on the size of your index.

### Step 4: Clean Up

Once the import is complete and you have verified that your search is working correctly, you should remove the `--import-dump` flag from your `docker-compose.yml` to prevent it from running on every startup.

1.  **Remove the `--import-dump` line** from the `command` section of the `meilisearch` service in `docker-compose.yml`.
2.  **Restart the services** one last time:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

Your Meilisearch instance is now upgraded and running with your migrated data.
