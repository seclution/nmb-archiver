# Upgrading Your Instance

This guide provides instructions for upgrading your NMB Archiver instance to the latest version.

## Checking for New Versions

NMB Archiver automatically checks for new versions and will display a notification in the footer of the web interface when an update is available. You can find a list of all releases and their release notes on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/seclution/OpenArchiver/releases) page.

## Upgrading Your Instance

To upgrade your NMB Archiver instance, follow these steps:

1.  **Pull the latest changes from the repository**:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Pull the latest Docker images**:

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```

3.  **Restart the services with the new images**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

This will restart your NMB Archiver instance with the latest version of the application.

## Migrating Data

When you upgrade to a new version, database migrations are applied automatically when the application starts up. This ensures that your database schema is always up-to-date with the latest version of the application.

No manual intervention is required for database migrations.

## Upgrading Meilisearch

When an NMB Archiver update includes a major version change for Meilisearch, you will need to manually migrate your search data. This process is not covered by the standard upgrade commands.

For detailed instructions, please see the [Meilisearch Upgrade Guide](./meilisearch-upgrade.md).
