# Jobs API

The Jobs API provides endpoints for monitoring the job queues and the jobs within them.

## Overview

NMB Archiver uses a job queue system to handle asynchronous tasks like email ingestion and indexing. The system is built on Redis and BullMQ and uses a producer-consumer pattern.

### Job Statuses

Jobs can have one of the following statuses:

- **active:** The job is currently being processed.
- **completed:** The job has been completed successfully.
- **failed:** The job has failed after all retry attempts.
- **delayed:** The job is delayed and will be processed at a later time.
- **waiting:** The job is waiting to be processed.
- **paused:** The job is paused and will not be processed until it is resumed.

### Errors

When a job fails, the `failedReason` and `stacktrace` fields will contain information about the error. The `error` field will also be populated with the `failedReason` for easier access.

### Job Preservation

Jobs are preserved for a limited time after they are completed or failed. This means that the job counts and the jobs that you see in the API are for a limited time.

- **Completed jobs:** The last 1000 completed jobs are preserved.
- **Failed jobs:** The last 5000 failed jobs are preserved.

## Get All Queues

- **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/jobs/queues`
- **Description:** Retrieves a list of all job queues and their job counts.
- **Permissions:** `manage:all`
- **Responses:**
    - `200 OK`: Returns a list of queue overviews.
    - `401 Unauthorized`: If the user is not authenticated.
    - `403 Forbidden`: If the user does not have the required permissions.

    - `page` (number, optional): The page number to retrieve. Defaults to `1`.
    - `limit` (number, optional): The number of jobs to retrieve per page. Defaults to `10`.
- **Responses:**
    - `200 OK`: Returns a detailed view of the queue, including a paginated list of jobs.
